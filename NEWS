--------------------------
2.0.0   2025-03-25

MAJOR CHANGES
    o   confintMSmix(...):
        [::] modified implementation of the Hessian matrix to jointly compute the asymptotic CIs for precisions and weights.
    o   data_censoring(...):
        [::] replaced former character argument `type` with the logical `topk`.

MINOR CHANGES
    o   MSmix-package.Rd and DESCRIPTION files:
        [::] replaced "hessian-based" with "asymptotic" to refer to the confidence intervals computed with confintMSmix(...).
    o   bootstrapMSmix(...):
        [::] removed rounding of the CI limits returned for the continuous parameters.
    o   print.bootMSmix(...):
        [::] rounding applied to the CI limits displyed for the continuous parameters.

NEW FUNCTIONS
    o   `print.bootMSmix(...)` for printing the bootstrapped CIs.
    o   `print.ciMSmix(...)` for printing the asymptotic CIs.
    o   `rearrange_output_mix(...)` for relabelling the mixture components in the MLEs of the MMS mixture parameters.

NEW FEATURES
    o   plot.bootMSmix(...), plot.data_descr(...) and plot.emMSmix(...):
        [::] plots are returned as elements of the output list instead of being directly displayed in the graphical window.

DOCUMENTATION
    o   The manual has been globally reviewed and updated with the new implementation details.
    o   Documentation added for all the internal (non-exported) functions.
