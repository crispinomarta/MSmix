\title{Finite Mixtures of Mallows Models with Spearman Distance for Full and Partial Rankings}
\description{
The \pkg{MSmix} package provides functions to fit and analyze finite
Mixtures of Mallows models with Spearman distance (a.k.a. \eqn{\theta}-model)
for full and partial rankings with arbitrary missing positions.
Inference is conducted within the maximum likelihood (ML) framework via EM algorithms.
Estimation uncertainty is tackled via diverse versions of bootstrapping
as well as via Hessian-based standard errors calculations.

\details{
The \emph{Mallows model} is one of the most popular and frequently applied
parametric distributions to analyze rankings of a finite set of items.
However, inference for this model is challenging due to the intractability
of the normalizing constant, also referred to as \emph{partition function}.
The present package performs ML estimation (MLE) of the Mallows model with Spearman distance
from full and partial rankings with arbitrary censoring patterns.
Thanks to the novel approximation of the model normalizing constant introduced by
Crispino, Mollica, Astuti and Tardella (2023), as well as the existence of
a closed-form expression of the MLE of the consensus ranking, \pkg{MSmix} can address inference even for a large number of items.
The package also allows to account for unobserved sample heterogeneity through MLE of
\emph{finite mixtures of Mallows models with Spearman distance} via EM algorithms, in order to
perform a model-based clustering of partial rankings into groups with similar preferences.

Computational efficiency is achieved with the use of a hybrid language, combining \code{R} and \code{C++} code,
and the possibility of parallel computation.

In addition to inferential techniques, the package provides various
functions for data manipulation, simulation, descriptive summary and model selection.

Specific S3 classes and methods are also supplied to enhance the usability
and foster exchange with other packages.

Some quantities frequently recalled in the manual are the following:
\describe{
\item{\eqn{N}}{Sample size.}
\item{\eqn{n}}{Number of possible items.}
\item{\eqn{G}}{Number of mixture components.}
}
Data must be supplied as an integer \eqn{N}\eqn{\times}{x}\eqn{n} matrix with partial rankings in each row and missing positions denoted as NA (rank = 1 indicates the
most-liked item). Partial sequences with a single missing entry are
automatically filled in, as they correspond to full rankings. In the present setting, ties are not allowed.
